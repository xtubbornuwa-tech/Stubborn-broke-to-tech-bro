# Degen Survival Kit

A growing list of hard-earned lessons, tools, and tips for surviving the meme coin jungle.  
I lost a lot. I learned more. This is my way of helping others not go through the same.

## What's inside:
- How to spot a rug before it yanks you
- Tools every degen should have
- Mistakes I made so you don’t have to
- Unfiltered advice from the trenches

Still building. Still stubborn. Still standing.

# How to Spot a Rug

Don’t get wrecked. These are the signs I wish I saw earlier:

- No liquidity lock or fake lock
- Anonymous devs with zero online presence
- Telegram group full of hype, no substance
- Charts that look too clean (straight up = straight down)
- No GitHub, no whitepaper, no roadmap
- Contract renounced too early or not at all
- Promoters dumping silently mid-hype
- Claims of “audit” with no links

Always ask: who benefits if this dies tomorrow?

# Tools I Used (and Still Use)

Here are some tools that helped me DYOR and survive the wild:

- **DexTools** – chart tracking and live pair info
- **TokenSniffer** – fast rug pull detection
- **ETHplorer / BscScan** – wallet & contract analysis
- **RugDoc** – audit/risk scores (esp. for DeFi)
- **Twitter / CT Threads** – real-time sentiment
- **Telegram** – vibe check (but be careful)
- **Devsellingbot (@devsellingbot)** – shows wallet clusters, fake buys, early sells. Real lifesaver.
- *Solscan for more details on wallet sepcific wallet of creator moving funny 

A tool is only as good as the person using it. Never rely on one source.

- Liquidity not locked or very low
- Dev wallet owns majority of token supply
- Fake influencer shills
- Zero community engagement
- Sketchy whitepaper or none at all
- Overpromising gains (e.g., "100x in 24hrs")
- Weird contract behavior (anti-sell, high tax)
- No multi-sig wallet or contract control

# Lessons I Paid For

- **FOMO is the quickest way to go broke** – I bought green candles and held red bags.
- **Hype doesn’t equal value** – Hype can create exit liquidity for others.
- **If it’s too good to be true, it usually is** – especially in a Telegram group.
- **Not every dump is a dip** – some are the beginning of the end.
- **Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose** – I learned this the hard way.
- **Follow the money, not the noise** – track wallets, not influencers.

Every L was tuition. Now I’m building smarter.
